#UAParser [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/randyzwitch/UAParser.jl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/randyzwitch/UAParser.jl)

UAParser is a Julia port of ua-parser(https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser), which itself is a multi-language port of [BrowserScope's](http://www.browserscope.org) [user agent string parser](http://code.google.com/p/ua-parser/). Per the [README file](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/README.markdown) from that project:

"The crux of the original parser--the data collected by [Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com/) over the years--has been extracted into a separate [YAML file](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/blob/master/regexes.yaml) so as to be reusable _as is_ by implementations in other programming languages."

UAParser is a limited Julia implementation heavily influenced by the [Python code](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/tree/master/py) from the ua-parser library.

##Code examples

##Validation testing

Validation of the results provided by UAParser will be evaluated against the [test files](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/tree/master/test_resources) provided by the maintainers of the ua-parser library as feasible. Currently, only the the `parsedevice` function passes all test cases; functions `parseos`, `parseuseragent` and `parseall` have been validated against selected examples and will be validated against the full test file suite at a future date.

Testing will be eventually built into the Travis build as well.


##Licensing

The data contained in regexes.yaml is Copyright 2009 Google Inc. and available under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The licensing of the UAParser Julia module is under the [default MIT Expat license](https://github.com/randyzwitch/UAParser.jl/blob/master/LICENSE.md) as generated by the default `Pkg.generate` function in Julia, and will do so until such time as I understand that it needs to be changed to accomodate either the regexes.yaml file or that using the Python code as a template requires a change in licensing.
